1. Start by implementing sys_pgaccess() in kernel/sysproc.c.

2. You'll need to parse arguments using argaddr() and argint().

3. For the output bitmask, it's easier to store a temporary buffer in the kernel and copy it to the user (via copyout()) after filling it with the right bits.

4. It's okay to set an upper limit on the number of pages that can be scanned.

5. walk() in kernel/vm.c is very useful for finding the right PTEs.

6. You'll need to define PTE_A, the access bit, in kernel/riscv.h. Consult the RISC-V manual to determine its value.

7. Be sure to clear PTE_A after checking if it is set. Otherwise, it won't be possible to determine if the page was accessed since the last time pgaccess() was called (i.e., the bit will be set forever).

8. vmprint() may come in handy to debug page tables.
