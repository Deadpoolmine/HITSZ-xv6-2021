1. Your first task is to delete page allocation from the sbrk(n) system call implementation, which is the function sys_sbrk() in sysproc.c. The sbrk(n) system call grows the process's memory size by n bytes, and then returns the start of the newly allocated region (i.e., the old size). Your new sbrk(n) should just increment the process's size (myproc()->sz) by n and return the old size. It should not allocate memory -- so you should delete the call to growproc() (but you still need to increase the process's size!).

2. The "usertrap(): ..." message is from the user trap handler in trap.c; it has caught an exception that it does not know how to handle. Make sure you understand why this page fault occurs. The "stval=0x0..04008" indicates that the virtual address that caused the page fault is 0x4008.
